# Cough Classification

## Overview
This folder contains notebooks for classification of cough and other voices, and dry coughs and wet coughs.

## Contents
- **cough-detection.ipynb**:  This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of cough and other audio recordings, including classification using various machine learning algorithms for comparative evaluation.

- **cough-detection-neural-network.ipynb**:  This notebook introduces neural networks or classifying coughs and other audio recordings using melspectrograms. Please note that it is a work in progress and is not yet completed.
 
- **classification-knn-svm.ipynb**: This notebook uses KNN and SVM algorithms to classify cough and other recordings. The prediction is based on percentile and MFCC features. It includes Principle Component Analysis.
                                                    
- **cough-dry-wet-detection.ipynb**:  This notebook aims to classify coughs as dry or wet. It is currently a work in progress, with ongoing improvements expected to enhance its performance.

- **test-filter.ipynb**: This notebooks verifies the correctness of signal filter implementation.

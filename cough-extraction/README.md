- cough-extraction-single-recordings-time-domain: This notebook analyzes the single cough audio, and extract the cough parts from the audio.
                                                  The analysis is based on time domain.
                                                  
- cough-extraction-single-recordings-frequency-domain: This notebook analyzes the single cough audio, and extract the cough parts from the audio. The                                                         analysis is based on frequency domain.
  
- cough-extraction-multiple-recordings-time-domain: This notebook extends the analysis to handle multiple cough audio recordings present in a given                                                        folder. It iterates through all the cough audio files in the specified directory, performing                                                           analysis and extraction in the time domain.
